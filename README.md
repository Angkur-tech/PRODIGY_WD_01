This project is a modern, responsive landing page for "Jolpan"—a restaurant specializing in Assamese cuisine—designed to showcase the richness and diversity of flavors from Assam. The website features a smooth navigation bar, attractive hero section, well-structured menu highlights, engaging informational sections, and interactive buttons for ordering food and table booking.

**Features**:

- Responsive Navbar: Stays fixed at the top with smooth background transition on scroll and an accessible mobile menu toggle.
- Hero Section: Full-screen banner with a striking background image that introduces the restaurant’s theme and message.
- Menu Overview: Lists the variety of Assamese food categories, emphasizing tradition and seasonality.
- About Section: Provides insights into the restaurant’s philosophy and its commitment to authentic local flavors.
- Contact, Order, Book Sections: Clearly laid out for customer engagement, with interactive "Order Now" and "Book Now" buttons.
- Styling: Clean layout using CSS Flexbox, vibrant button interactions, dark mode accents, and mobile-first adjustments for seamless experience on any device.
- JavaScript: Adds scroll-based navbar effects and manages the mobile-friendly menu toggle for usability.

**Tech Stack**:

- HTML5 and CSS3 for structure and styling
- Vanilla JavaScript for interactivity

**Usage**:

Clone the repository, add your preferred images (replace the hero section image as needed), and update contact information to deploy the page for any Assam-themed restaurant or food service.

**Customization Ideas**:

- Expand menu details with dynamic cards or gallery
- Integrate a real booking/order backend (such as form handlers or APIs)
- Add testimonial or review sections for enhanced engagement



This landing page is an ideal starting point for restaurant web projects, combining modern design trends with local cultural storytelling and interactive UX elements.
